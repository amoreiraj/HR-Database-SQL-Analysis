# HR Database SQL Analysis üìä

## üîç Overview

This project is based on the official Oracle Database 19c: SQL Workshop (1Z0-071) and has been expanded into a comprehensive, real-world HR analytics schema with **15 interrelated tables**.

While the core tables originate from the Oracle SQL certification course, additional custom tables were added to reflect modern HR practices, such as `PERFORMANCE_REVIEWS`, `PAYROLL`, `TRAINING_COURSES`, `ATTENDANCE`, and `EMPLOYEE_SKILLS`. These extensions support deeper analysis, scenario based querying, and portfolio level demonstration.

## üéØ Objectives
- Prepare for the Oracle SQL Associate Certification (1Z0-071)
- Demonstrate practical SQL and database design skills
- Apply analytical thinking to real-world HR data
- Build a data analyst portfolio project using SQL

## üë• Ideal For
- Database Developers
